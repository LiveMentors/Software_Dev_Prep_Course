## Basics of Git/GitHub

Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source version control tool. Git is a tool that allows you to track changes to your project/code, so you can go back back to earlier versions, if needed. It's like saving multiple snapshots of your project as you work on it. 
GitHub is a company that make tools that integrate with git.
    
| Feature       | Git                          |GitHub                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| What it is    | A version control system (tool) | A web-based platform (service)              |
| Purpose       | Tracks changes in your code locally | Hosts your Git repositories online          |
| Key Function  | Manages version history and collaboration | Facilitates sharing, collaboration, and teamwork |
| Where it runs | On your computer (installed software) | On the internet (requires an account)       |
| Offline/Online| Works offline                | Requires internet to sync or collaborate    |
| Example Use   | Save file versions on your own computer | Share files with a team, review code changes |

In simple terms:

- Git helps you keep track changes to your code locally.
- GitHub helps you store and share that code with others, online. 

### Why Git?
Why do we need to create snapshots in Git?

When you would create applications, you would have multiple versions. For example, you might have version 1.0, version 2.0, etc. and continue to add feature and improvements. If you made a critical mistake, you could use Git to easily revert back to the previous working version.

This also solved the issue of working with multiple developers on a project. With Git, 2 developers may independently work on two different versions starting from the same stable version. Then at a later date, git allows them to merge their work.

All programmers need to use Git. You cannot be successful without it.
